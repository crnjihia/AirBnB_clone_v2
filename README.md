## **Project Overview**

AirBnB Clone v2, also referred to as ALXBnB, is a complete web application designed to mimic the functionality of the AirBnB platform. This project integrates various components, including:

- **Database Storage:** Persistent storage for managing application data using SQL.
- **Back-End API:** A robust back-end interface to handle application logic and data processing.
- **Front-End Interfacing:** An interactive user interface to simulate the experience of the AirBnB platform (future implementation phases).

Currently, the project focuses on the back-end console, enabling efficient interaction with the system through a command-line interface.

## **Features**

- **Object-Oriented Programming:**

  - Class-based models to define essential AirBnB components, such as users, places, reviews, and bookings.

- **Persistent Storage:**

  - Data stored using relational databases, ensuring consistency and scalability.

- **Console Functionality:**

  - A command-line tool to create, update, delete, and query objects seamlessly.

- **Modularity:**
  - Structured codebase for easy maintenance and future scalability.

## **Future Enhancements**

The project aims to extend its current capabilities by implementing:

- A fully interactive web-based front-end.
- Advanced API endpoints for dynamic operations.
- Integration of additional features, such as payment processing and enhanced search filters.
